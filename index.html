    <p><b><u>From the years 732 to 778:</b></u> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lourdes" target="_blank">Lourdes</a> was possessed by Muslims of Al-Andalus.[7] However, during the 8th century, Lourdes and its fortress became the focus of skirmishes between Mirat, the Muslim local leader, and Charlemagne, King of the Franks. Charlemagne had been laying siege to Mirat in the fortress for some time, but the Moor had so far refused to surrender. According to legend, an eagle unexpectedly appeared and dropped an enormous trout at the feet of Mirat. It was seen as such a bad omen that Mirat was persuaded to surrender to the Queen of the Sky by the local bishop. He visited the Black Virgin of Puy to offer gifts, so he could make sure this was the best course of action and, astounded by its exceptional beauty, he decided to surrender the fort and converted to Christianity. On the day of his baptism, Mirat took on the name of Lorus, which was given to the town, now known as Lourdes.

        claimed a beautiful lady appeared to her in the remote Grotto of Massabielle. This lady later identified herself as the Immaculate Conception and the faithful believed her to be the Blessed Virgin Mary. The lady appeared 18 times, and by 1859 thousands of pilgrims were visiting Lourdes. A statue of Our Lady of Lourdes was erected at the site in 1864.

    <h3>1917</h3>
    <p><b><u>In 1916:</b></u>, on three occasions, Lúcia dos Santos and her two cousins, Francisco and Jacinta Marto, began reporting apparitions of an angel in the region of Valinhos.</p>
    <p> According to the children, these blessed visitations began on the <b>13 May 1917</b> when, while tending their family's sheep in Cova da Iria, they said they witnessed the apparition of what they later wholeheartedly believed was the Virgin Mary, and began doing penance and self-sacrifice to atone for sinners. Many flocked to Fátima and Aljustrel to witness these declared apparitions along with the children, but not before the children were jailed for being politically disruptive.[1]</p>
    <p>These visitations culminated on the <b><u>13 October 1917</u></b> public Miracle of the Sun event, the children imparted that the apparition of Virgin Mary divulged three secrets to the children. Although the Miracle of the Sun marked the children's last claimed apparition, the region of Fátima continued to be a destination for pilgrims.
